Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

CHAPTER 2 — The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

CHAPTER 2 — The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

CHAPTER 2 — The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

CHAPTER 2 — The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

CHAPTER 2 — The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral

thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.

CHAPTER 2 — The Carpet-Bag.
I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the 
Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in 
December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and 
that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

CHAPTER 3 — The Spouter-Inn.
Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-fashioned 
wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oilpainting 
so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was 
only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, that you could, in any one given time, derive 
anything like a definite idea of its purpose.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery 
part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever 
I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever 
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral 
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral 
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's 
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; 
I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their 
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown 
is the Battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous 
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from 
thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels, all around the town, stand 
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated 
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath 
and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields 
gone? What do they here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! 
Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder 
warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. 
And there they stand—miles of them—leagues.
